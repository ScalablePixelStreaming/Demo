# Demo
This repository contains the source of the demo UE project that is shipped with Scalable Pixel Streaming.

## Installing the Unreal Engine

Follow the [official documentation](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download) or access the [official repository](https://github.com/EpicGames) to download and install the Unreal Engine on your chosen platform. The demo project is compatible with UE version 5.0 or newer.

## Building the project

1. Launch the Unreal Editor.
2. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/ScalablePixelStreaming/Demo.git`.
3. Open the VehicleTouch50.uproject file in the editor. The project is already set up with the Pixel Streaming plugin enabled.
4. If your target platform is Linux, the project is ready for packaging out of the box. Follow the steps in the [official UE documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/packaging-unreal-engine-projects?application_version=5.3) to package the project.
5. If your target is Windows and your chosen cloud platform supports Windows containers, refer to [our documentation](https://docs.scalablestreaming.io/) for detailed information on preparing your Windows UE project, as there are additional mandatory steps.
6. Once your project is packaged for your target platform, you are ready to deploy it to your SPS formation.
7. If your cloud platform supports creating versions from a compressed UE project, create a `.zip` archive and [upload it directly via the CLI tool or dashboard](
https://docs.scalablestreaming.io/getting-started/deploying).
8. If your cloud platform doesn't support creating versions from a compressed UE project, use our Image Builder Tool to [create a container image suitable for deploying on SPS](
https://docs.scalablestreaming.io/getting-started/building-container).
9. [Create a version](https://docs.scalablestreaming.io/getting-started/deploying) using the newly created container tag. Your application should now be ready to stream.

Refer to our documentation for a more detailed look into Scalable Streaming entities hierarchy and step-by-step deployment guides.
